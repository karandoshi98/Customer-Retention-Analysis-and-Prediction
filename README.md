Customer Retention Analysis and Prediction in R.

Dataset - 
https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
20 Independent Variables and 1 Dependent Variables

Prerequisites libraries-
h2o, data.table, purr, ggplot2, hrbrthemes, lattice, plyr, scales


Things I have done in the project - 
1. Predicted the missing(NA) values of column 'Total Charges' using neural network.

2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to understand and find the important columns.

3. Predicted for a new entry whether the customer will retain the service or not using Two models - Grdient boosting Algorithm and then Neural networks.
